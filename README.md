This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the "NObeyesdad" column in a dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to body measurements and eating habits. The main objective is to explore the data, preprocess it for modeling, and identify the best machine learning algorithm for predicting the "NObeyesdad" column.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Structure and Cleaning
- Checked the structure of the dataset for incorrect and null values.
- Imputed missing values using the mean of the respective columns.
- Prepared the data for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of height and weight.
- Identified the top 10 ages with the highest weight.
- Examined the distribution of CAEC (consumption of food between meals) values.
- Calculated average ages with a family history of being overweight.
- Generated a correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Applied label encoding to categorical columns.
- Standardized continuous columns using a standard scaler.
- Used one-hot encoding for necessary categorical columns.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Selection and Prediction
- Determined whether the prediction task is a regression or classification problem.
- Evaluated multiple algorithms suitable for the problem type.
- Identified the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy and other performance metrics.

### 5. Results
- Provided the name of the best-performing algorithm.
- Included a detailed classification report and confusion matrix for the model.
